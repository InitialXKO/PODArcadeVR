# PODArcadeVR
Simple Unity app for use with VR Headsets and Teknoparrot to emulate the display of POD style arcade games. 

Config setup is as follows:

R - reset the camera position to the seat.
W - Increase height by .1 incriment
S - Decrease heigh by .1 incriment

*note These keys will ONLY work if the simulator is selected as the main window.

To use properly, start up the game in Teknoparrot, and then run this app. It WILL open up SteamVR, so I recommend having that installed before using (shouldnt matter too much with the headset used, as it supports most of them.) 

For best experience, make sure the game is running in FULL Screen.
